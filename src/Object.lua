This is the object class which stores objects.

All objects are defined from object_defs this contains all definitions for all objects. 
These definitions tell the game the quads for the object along with its size and it will even 
tell the game which general area to place the object(under walls ect..). 

This game is completely tile based, because of this the objects are too. So, in procedural generation it scans a 
tile_map of the house and then places the object in a separate objects tile_map.  

Now you might be asking, how did you get objects with a width/height of more than one to be tile based? 
First, I made it so that on the tile_map the object's origin location only takes up one tile. When the tile_map 
is running through tiles to render and an objects origin tile is rendered the object class render function is 
called which renders the whole object. So, when 1 tile is rendered the whole object renders.  

It does this by taking the width and height of the object and sequentially for each width/height it offsets the 
gridX/gridY and QuadX/QuadY by 1 which in turn gives the illusion of a whole object being there. 
There is a specific equation with the QuadX and QuadY such that it gives the actual Quad from the atlas. 

An advantage of this system is that another object can go on top of what appears to be that object as long as it's 
not on the origin tile of the object. The origin tile being the tile that contains the object.  

Using the same system but with gridX and gridY the object class also returns collidable positions. 
The tile_map when looking if something would collide with an object sorts through all the objects in the tile map and c
hecks their collidable positions. 
 
An object's definitions can specify what tiles are collidable on the object, if the object is collidable,
if the object is stealable, the object's general placement, as well as width/height etc.â€¦

The render function was built such that the object is saved at one tile in a tileMap however it will render the whole object based on width and height.

Now you might be asking, how did you get objects with a width/height of more than one to be tile based?
Well first I made it so that on the tile_map the reall object only takes up one tile. However when this 1 tile is rendered
it renders the whole object, in the Object class. It does this by taking the width and height and sequentially for each width/height it moves
the object on the x/y axis by one tile alonng with changing the quadX/quadY by this value and rendering. Giving the illusion of a whole object being there. 

An advantage of this system is that another object can go on top of what appears to be that object as long as it's not on the origin tile of the object.
The origin tile being the tile that contains the object. 

tileOffset - this is how the tile is actually offseted
quadOffset - this is the quad and how it is offseted when peicing throughh quads
